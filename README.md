### About Me:
- Hi and I'm a person who's dream is to be an animator! I'm currently a student at Ateneo de Naga University and while I only have 2 years left here, I want to make the best out of them!There's still a lot to know about me so let's not waste anymore time and jump straight into it!

### My Interests:
- I really like drawing and I want to know everything about it. When I was in grade 4, I had a friend who my classmates always went to because he was really good in drawing. I was inspired by his works and decided that I want to be just like him. 4 years later and here we are today. I still have a lot to go through but I'm excited for all of it!
- I also like writing stories and coming up with fictional characters and their backgrounds. This is related to my first interest since I like to draw them out as well.
- I like listening to music because it helps me to be inspired and come up with new ideas for my next projects. It also helps me unwind and release my worries and troubles of my everyday life.
- I don't know if anyone knows this but I like to build "Gundam" figures. They are just like action figures but with a mix of Lego. You have to build the figure itself before you can do anything else with it.
