### About Me:
- Hi and I'm a person who's dream is to be an animator! I'm currently a student at Ateneo de Naga University and while I only have 2 years left here, I want to make the best out of them! There's still a lot to know about me so let's not waste anymore time and jump straight into it!

### My Interests:
- I really like drawing and I want to know everything about it. When I was in grade 4, I had a friend who my classmates always went to because he was really good in drawing. I was inspired by his works and decided that I want to be just like him. 4 years later and here we are today. I still have a lot to go through but I'm excited for all of it!
- I also like writing stories and coming up with fictional characters and their backgrounds. This is related to my first interest since I like to draw them out as well.
- I like listening to music because it helps me to be inspired and come up with new ideas for my next projects!
r my next projects. It also helps me unwind and release my worries and troubles of my everyday life.
- I don't know if anyone knows this but I like to build "Gundam" figures. They are just like action figures but with a mix of Lego. You have to build the figure itself before you can do anything else with it.
  
### Artworks:
Here are some of my works that took a lot of time and love! These artworks are some of my best and I hope that you guys can appreciate them as well.
